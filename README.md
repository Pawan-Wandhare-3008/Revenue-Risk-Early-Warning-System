# Revenue Risk Early Warning System

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Revenue Risk Early Warning System built using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

The goal of the system is to detect revenue leakage and operational instability before it impacts financial performance.


## 🎯 Business Objective

Organizations often detect revenue decline only after financial damage occurs.

This project focuses on identifying early warning signals such as:

- Rising cancellation percentage
- Increasing payment failure rate
- Operational volatility spikes
- High-risk operational days
- Revenue leakage trends


## 🏗️ Project Workflow

The project follows an end-to-end analytics pipeline:

1. Python – Synthetic data generation and risk scoring
2. SQL – Risk trend analysis and baseline detection
3. Power BI – Executive dashboard and risk visualization


## 📊 Key KPIs Built

- Risk Severity Index
- Revenue Leakage %
- High Risk Day Count
- Risk Volatility
- Payment Failure Rate
- Operational Risk Indicators


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL
- Power BI (DAX, Data Modeling)
- Synthetic Data Engineering


## 📌 Outcome

The system provides proactive risk detection and helps leadership take early corrective action instead of reacting after losses occur.
