# Revenue Risk Early Warning System

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Revenue Risk Early Warning System is an end-to-end analytics project designed to proactively detect revenue leakage, operational instability, and escalating business risks before they significantly impact financial performance.

This project simulates a real-world enterprise environment and demonstrates how data can be transformed into early warning intelligence using:

-Python (Data Simulation & Risk Scoring)

-SQL (Risk Detection & Baseline Analysis)

-Power BI (Executive Risk Intelligence Dashboard)


## 🎯 Business Objective

Organizations often detect revenue decline only after financial damage occurs.

This project focuses on identifying early warning signals such as:

- Rising cancellation percentage
- Increasing payment failure rate
- Operational volatility spikes
- High-risk operational days
- Revenue leakage trends


## 🏗️ Project Workflow

The project follows an end-to-end analytics pipeline:

1. Python – Synthetic data generation and risk scoring
2. SQL – Risk trend analysis and baseline detection
3. Power BI – Executive dashboard and risk visualization


## 📊 Key KPIs Built

- Risk Severity Index
- Revenue Leakage %
- High Risk Day Count
- Risk Volatility
- Payment Failure Rate
- Operational Risk Indicators


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL
- Power BI (DAX, Data Modeling)
- Synthetic Data Engineering


## 📌 Outcome

The system provides proactive risk detection and helps leadership take early corrective action instead of reacting after losses occur.
